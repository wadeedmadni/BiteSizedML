# Future Scope of BiteSizedML
As BiteSizedML continues to evolve, we aim to build a more comprehensive and robust resource. Below are some ideas for future enhancements:

1. **Expanded Terminology:** We will continue adding definitions to cover all concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI at large, ensuring that BiteSizedML grows with the advancements in the field.

2. **Multilingual Support:** To make BiteSizedML accessible to non-English speakers, we plan to include terminology definitions in other languages.

3. **Examples and Use-cases:** We intend to incorporate simple examples and use-cases alongside definitions to give a practical understanding of the terms.

4. **GitHub Pages Site:** We envision creating a GitHub Pages site for BiteSizedML, offering an intuitive interface where users can easily navigate through the glossary. This user-friendly site will further enhance the learning experience for everyone delving into Machine Learning.
